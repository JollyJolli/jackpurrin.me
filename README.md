**This is the offical repository for my [website](https://jackpurrin.me)**

## About 🤘
I made this website because I just wanted a personal space to put the things I wanted and what my friends wanted, that's why there is games on my site. 
I enjoy playing games like Minecraft and Half-Life, but am very explorative about what games I play.
I have a server running Debian 12 that hosts my Minecraft server.

## Feature Requests ✔
If you wish to add a game, a site, or anything else, visit the `Issues` tab in this github repository.
You can request games, other sites, a program you want me to make, or just really anything! Go ahead, request something!

## Blocked? 🚫
If my website is blocked, I have another website. You can head to [jackpurrin.rf.gd](https://jackpurrin.rf.gd). This is an ok alternative, but this other site has a big warning, and won't be updated as often. It will get updated to my main site evantually, or I can find a workaround to figure out how to link this repostitory to an unblocked domain of this site. But for now, it'll do.

## Need Help ❓
Wanna make your own site, or want help with any sort of thing relating to computers? Go to my website and find the proper way to contact me, or you can just head down below to the `Contact` section.
